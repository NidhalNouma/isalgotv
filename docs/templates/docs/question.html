            {% include 'include/qanda_item.html' with id=6 title='Do I need a paid TradingView account?' description='No, a free TradingView account is enough to get started. However, the free version has some limitations — for example, you can only have one active alert and one chart with one strategy. A paid TradingView plan is recommended for full functionality, especially if you plan to use automation.' %}

            {% include 'include/qanda_item.html' with id=9 title='Can I trust the performance reports?' description='Yes. Our reports reflect the actual backtested performance of each strategy over a specific time period. The longer the period covered, the more reliable the results. Keep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results, but it gives you a solid basis for evaluating a strategy.' %}
            {% include 'include/qanda_item.html' with id=10 title='Can I change or cancel my plan?' description='Yes, you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at any time. When you upgrade, remaining time converts into extra days on your new plan. Downgrades take effect after the current billing period ends. When you cancel, you keep access until the end of your current period.' %}
