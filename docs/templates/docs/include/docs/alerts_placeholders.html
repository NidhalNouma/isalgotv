          <h3>Placeholders</h3>
    
          <p>
            These placeholders can be used in the alert message, and they will be
            replaced with dynamic values when the alert is triggered. They are the
            sole method for including dynamic values that can vary from bar to bar.
            <br/><span>The placeholders need to be enclosed within double curly braces.</span> Below are the placeholders you can use:
